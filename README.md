# Introduction

I created this `init.lua` file by starting with [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) and then modifying the file based on the following videos
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ybCiHPWKNA
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8C0Cq9Uv9o
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6AR2RMB5tE

and some others.
